# Solana Donation Platform

A simple **Solana-based transparent donation website** built as a student project for the **Superteam Nepal** bounty.

This project demonstrates how blockchain (Solana) can enable **transparent, corruption-free donations** to NGOs and INGOs in Nepal.

Live Demo: https://solana-project-theta.vercel.app/ 
Repository: https://github.com/khatiwada-alish/solana_project

## Project Overview

This website is a proof-of-concept donation platform running on **Solana devnet/testnet**. Users can connect their Solana wallet and make donations to selected Nepali NGOs/INGOs in a fully transparent way — every transaction is recorded on-chain and publicly verifiable.
but for testing purpose we are not using main net so no real moeny 


### Why this project matters for Nepal

Nepal currently has a **ban on cryptocurrency and blockchain transactions** 

However, blockchain technology has huge potential for the future:  
- When regulations change , this platform can be easily upgraded to **Solana mainnet**.  
- It allows **100% transparent donations** — donors can verify exactly where their money goes, reducing corruption and building trust.  
- Perfect for supporting education, health, disaster relief, and community projects run by Nepali NGOs and INGOs.

This project is a small step toward preparing Nepal for a blockchain-enabled future.

This is my first real Web3 project — made as a 1st-semester student at **Samriddhi College** using a lot of AI assistance. I'm not claiming to be an expert; this is me learning Solana step-by-step and exploring how blockchain could help Nepal in the future.
